Description: Automate the explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models.
    Generate advanced interactive model explanations in the form of a serverless HTML
    site with only one line of code. This tool is model agnostic, therefore compatible
    with most of the black box predictive models and frameworks. The main function
    computes various (instance and dataset level) model explanations and produces
    a customisable dashboard, which consists of multiple panels for plots with their
    short descriptions. Easily save the dashboard and share it with others. Tools
    for Explanatory Model Analysis unite with tools for Exploratory Data Analysis
    to give a broad overview of the model behavior.
